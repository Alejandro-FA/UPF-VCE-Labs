When opening the web you will find a simple first connection screen, where you can choose between 3 different avatars, input the room name you want and the same with your username. 

Once you push the connect button you will end up in the chatting screen. Once you're here, if someone else is in the chat, you will receive the previous messages. Using the input bar at the bottom you can enter messages and send them by pressing space or clicking the button at the right.

By using the input bar at the top left corner, you can connect yourself to a different chat. If the chat name starts with a "_", the channel will be private. If what follows the underscore is the id of a user in the room, you will be able to send messages to that user only. To know the ID, look at the number at the right of the '#' character next to the name.

If what follows the '_' is not an ID, only you will see your messages.
